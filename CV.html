My journey began in Stuttgart, Germany, where my fascination for precision engineering and innovative automotive technologies started. Growing up in an environment with automotive companies all around me, and many people I know also working in this field, influenced me to also pursue a career in that direction.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I've completed internships at well known companies like Mercedes Benz Cars AG and Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, gaining hands-on experience in sales and revenue controlling. At Mercedes Benz, I contributed to quarterly and monthly reporting, crafted PowerBI dashboards, and conducted key performance indicator analyses, directly impacting strategic decisions.During my tenure at Porsche, I assisted in coordinating sales for North America and in preparing comprehensive sales presentations for top executives.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  My academic path has been equally diverse and enriching. I started in the German-Chinese double degree in International Management from Hochschule Reutlingen and UIBE, Beijing. However, given the changing geopolitical landscape and the issues created by Covid-19 I decided to take the opportunity to switch to the German-Irish double degree. This decision was also influenced by me gaining a more critical perspective perspective on China during the first years of studying.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Currently, I'm in my final year of my International Management degree with a major in Business Analytics at Dublin City University.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Fluent in German, English, and intermediate in Chinese, I am equipped with substantial language skills and a profound understanding of multicultural environments. I am well versed in Microsoft Office applications, including PowerBI and Excel. I could showcase and further develop these skills during my internships.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  My goal is to leverage my skills and experiences within the automotive sector, where I can contribute to shaping the future of mobility. I want to continue with a masters program focusing on accounting. I also want to further develop my data analytics skills, applying my knowledge to more practical projects.
